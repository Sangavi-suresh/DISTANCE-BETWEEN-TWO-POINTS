# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:

To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1: 
Import math
### Step 2: 
Assign the values of two points
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
print the values
### Step 5: 
end the program

### PROGRAM:
```python

import math
l1 = [4,2]
l2 = [10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```

### OUTPUT:
